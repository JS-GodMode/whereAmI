## Introduction

Asynchronous programming is an essential part of JavaScript, allowing for non-blocking code execution. This repository contains a variety of implementations that demonstrate different asynchronous patterns, ranging from handling callbacks to using modern JavaScript features like Promises and async/await.

The goal of this repository is to serve as a reference for developers looking to improve their understanding of asynchronous programming in JavaScript.

## Features

- Examples of asynchronous programming using **callbacks**, **Promises**, and **async/await**.
- Real-world use cases involving **fetching data from APIs**, **handling geolocation**, and more.
- Code snippets with explanations on best practices for error handling in asynchronous code.
- Interactive demos that showcase asynchronous code in action.

## Technologies

- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Fetch API
- Promises
- Async/Await
- Geolocation API
- Other relevant APIs and libraries
